# Assignment 4: Advanced Graph Algorithms for City Service Task Networks

## Project Overview

This project applies graph algorithms to analyze networks of city service tasks. The datasets include activities such as street cleaning, infrastructure repairs, and maintenance of cameras or sensors, each containing internal analytical subtasks. Some task dependencies form cycles that must be identified and condensed, while others are acyclic and can be scheduled efficiently.

I developed and tested four main algorithms: Tarjan’s algorithm for detecting strongly connected components, Kahn’s method for topological ordering, shortest path calculation in directed acyclic graphs, and critical path evaluation. The project emphasized comparing actual performance with theoretical expectations using 18 different directed graphs modeled on city service operations.
